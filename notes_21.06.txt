Done:
@Paweł
- Let user create a game (generating game_ID is necessary)
- on /play/ website, let user create new Game


@Maciek
- Make use of game_ID to manage various games (Partially)
- Manage accessibility of all the game sessions via unique url (game_ID might be used) (Partially)
- Changed the game ID generation to be numeric-only (fixed some problems by doing so)


ToDo:

@Paweł
-CORRECTLY PERFORM MIGRATION!!!! (code doesn't work atm due to some new fields being added to Game model !!)
- let user their last 10 games history on '/play/' (describe them by ID or date of creation) and let them check history of
all the games played


@Maciej
-Change previous concept, so user can join using 'Join Game' button and providing the game ID, not using the URL.
