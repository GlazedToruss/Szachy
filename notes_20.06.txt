Done:
- Users + games database
- Login utility + page
- Improve client<->server connection and connect it with game logic to let user play the game


ToDo:
@Pawe≈Ç
- Let user create a game (generating game_ID is necessary)
- on /play/ website, let user create new game, show them their last 10 games history (describe them by ID or date of creation) and let them check history of
all the games played

@Maciek
- Make use of game_ID to manage various games
- Manage accessibility of all the game sessions via unique url (game_ID might be used)
